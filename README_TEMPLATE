= expectations

expectations is a lightweight unit testing framework. Tests (expectations) can be written as follows 

  expect 2 do 
    1 + 1 
  end 

  expect NoMethodError do 
    Object.invalid_method_call 
  end.

expectations is designed to encourage unit testing best practices such as
  - discourage setting more than one expectation at a time
  - promote maintainability by not providing a setup or teardown method
  - provide one syntax for setting up state based or behavior based expectation
  - focus on readability by providing no mechanism for describing an expectation other than the code in the expectation.

Mocking is done utilizing Mocha
