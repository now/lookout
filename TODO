Replace mock with mock('mock')?

Thoughts on mocking:

stub(Class).method

reads better than

Class.stubs(:method)

Perhaps even

Class.stub.method

would work, but if we use

stub(Class).method

we wonâ€™t have to add methods to Class.

The stubbing will be controlled by the suite and a new registry/space/mockery
will be created for each expectation.

We also want stubs to be able to act as nil objects, that is, always returning
themselves (or instances of their class) on calls, so that chaining works.

Also, only allow one expectation per mock, many stubs, though.
