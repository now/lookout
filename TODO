Another way of getting the subject into the mockery is to recreate it in
Reception:

@subject = Mocha::Mockery.instance.unnamed_mock if subject.is_a? Mocha::Mock

Is this perfectly safe?  I mean, people might be creating named mocks with
mock('name'), which won’t make it through if we do it this way, but that’s not
really very important.
