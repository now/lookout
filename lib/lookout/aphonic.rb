# A class whose instances only respond to very small set of methods.  This set
# consists of `#__send__` and #object_id (and `#__id__` in 1.8).  This makes it
# useful for DSLs and classes that make use of #method_missing.  Things are set
# up so that if methods are added to Kernel, Object, or Method after the
# initial set-up, such methods will similarly be {.silence}d.
