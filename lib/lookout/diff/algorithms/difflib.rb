# The difflib algorithm is based on the algorithm employed by the difflib
# library for Python, which is, in turn, based on an algorithm by Ratcliff and
# Obershelp.
#
# Itâ€™s implemented as an Enumerable over the {Match}es between two sequences,
# which makes it useful for a wide class of objects.
#
# @see http://docs.python.org/library/difflib.html

  # Initializes the algorithm object.  Optionally takes a block to determine
  # what elements in _to_ are to be ignored.  This can be used to, for example,
  # ignore whitespace differences.
  #
  # The elements in _from_ and _to_ must respond to #hash and #==.
  #
  # @param [#[]] from The original Enumerable
  # @param [#[]] to The new Enumerable that _from_ should become
  # @yieldparam element
