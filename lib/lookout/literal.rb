# Proxy for objects that should be literally expected.  This is achieved by
# overriding #to_lookout_expected to wrap the object in a
# {Lookout::Expected::Object} instead of using whatever #to_lookout_expected on
# the object would normally return.  This allows us to expect a literal {Range}
# instead of allowing either a Range or an item included in the range.
