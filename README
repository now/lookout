# Lookout #

Lookout is a lightweight unit testing framework. Tests (expectations) can be
written as follows

  expect 2 do
    1 + 1
  end

  expect NoMethodError do
    Object.invalid_method_call
  end.

Lookout is designed to encourage unit testing best practices such as

  - Discourage setting more than one expectation at a time
  - Promote maintainability by not providing a setup or teardown method
  - Provide one syntax for setting up state based or behavior based expectation
  - Focus on readability by providing no mechanism for describing an
    expectation other than the code in the expectation.

Lookout is heavily based on {expectations}[http://expectations.rubyforge.org],
by {Jay Fields}[http://blog.jayfields.com].  Modifications done to the
expectations code base after Subversion revision r76 are due to
{Nikolai Weibull}[http://bitwi.se].
