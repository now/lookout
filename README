# Lookout #

Lookout is a lightweight unit testing framework. Tests (expectations) can be
written as follows

    expect 2 do
      1 + 1
    end

    expect NoMethodError do
      Object.invalid_method_call
    end

Lookout is designed to encourage unit testing best practices such as

  * Disallow setting more than one expectation at a time
  * Promote maintainability by not providing a setup or teardown method
  * Provide one syntax for setting up state based or behavior based expectation
  * Focus on readability by providing no mechanism for describing an
    expectation other than the code in the expectation.

The way lookout works has been heavily influenced by [expectations][1], by [Jay
Fields][2].  The code base was once also heavily based on [expectations][1],
based at Subversion revision r76.  A lot has happened since then and all of the
work past that revision are due to [Nikolai Weibull][3].
